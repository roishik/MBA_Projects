### The Decision Process

**Phase 1: Information Gathering**
- Tuld demands explanation in plain English
- Bypasses Jared to speak directly with Peter (the source)
- Uses self-deprecation to put Peter at ease

**Phase 2: Understanding the Scope**
- $1.215 trillion exposure at MBS alone
- 25% decline would exceed company's market cap
- Already happening (past 2 weeks of losses)

**Phase 3: Tuld's Dramatic Pause**

- Uses metaphor: "the music appears to be about to stop"
- Confirms his read: "I don't hear... a... thing... just silence"

**Phase 4: Solution Seeking**
- Pivots immediately: "what can we do about it?"
- Articulates his philosophy: "Be first, be smarter, or cheat"
- Jared proposes: "Sell it all today"

**Phase 5: The Confrontation (Tuld vs. Sam)**
- Sam outlines execution plan (reluctantly)
- Sam raises ethical objections
- Tuld cuts him off: "We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price"
- Sam warns: "You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again"
- Tuld's intensity: "This is it, Sam, this is it!"

**Phase 6: Action Assignment**
- Jared gets 1 hour to create execution plan
