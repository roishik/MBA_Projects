## 0) Assignment summary (what you were asked to deliver)

You are completing an MBA individual assignment based on the **MLQ 360°** (Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire) using the **Full Range Leadership** model (Bass & Avolio).

You:
1. Filled in an MLQ-style leadership questionnaire about **your managerial/leadership style**.
2. Sent the same questionnaire to **colleagues (and manager)** and received results that include:
   - **Self**: how you rate yourself  
   - **Raters (Colleagues+Manager)**: how others rate you
3. Need to create a document that includes:
   - **(A)** Work context (where you work / worked recently, your role, who you sent the questionnaire to)
   - **(B)** Identification of gaps:
     - between the **ideal** leadership pattern and your current results
     - between **Self vs Others** (perception gaps)
   - **(C)** A focused transformation plan:
     - pick **two** measures you personally care about
     - explain why you selected them
     - propose a plan to become more **transformational**
     - goals should be **SMART** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)

---

## 1) MLQ / Full Range Leadership model  - terminology recap

### 1.1 Transformational leadership (the 4 I’s)
- **II  - Idealized Influence**  
  Role modeling, values, trust, credibility (“leading by example” / ethical influence).
- **IM  - Inspirational Motivation**  
  Vision, inspiration, meaning, motivation; communicating “why”.
- **IS  - Intellectual Stimulation**  
  Challenging thinking, creativity, reframing problems, encouraging innovation.
- **IC  - Individualized Consideration**  
  Mentoring/coaching, personal attention, development of others.

### 1.2 Transactional leadership
- **CR  - Contingent Reward**  
  Clear expectations + recognition/reward contingent on performance.
- **MBEA  - Management-by-Exception Active**  
  Active monitoring for deviations/risks; intervening early to correct.

### 1.3 Passive/Avoidant (“Non-leadership”)
- **MBEP  - Management-by-Exception Passive**  
  Intervening mainly **after** problems occur.
- **LF  - Laissez-Faire**  
  Avoiding involvement; non-decision / disengagement.

---

## 2) “What ideal looks like”  - as reinforced by the instructor material

From the instructor’s guidance (DeepTech MLQ + OKR handout):
- Desired overall pattern:
  - **Positive** (above norm) on the **4 I’s** (Transformational)
  - **CR** slightly positive (helpful complement)
  - **MBEA** negative but **less** negative than LF/MBEP (i.e., low-to-moderate)
  - **LF** very negative (low)
  - **MBEP** negative (low), typically not as extremely low as LF
- For OKRs (or any method): Instructor is agnostic on method; **requires SMART goals** and measurable progress.
- “Graph 2” interpretation: use **Standard Deviations** to see agreement; a heuristic threshold of **SD < 0.5** indicates low dispersion / more agreement. With small N, treat as indicative.

> **Document sources used**
> - HBR article PDF: *The Leader as Coach* (HBR 2019)  
> - Instructor handout PDF: “deeptech mlq okr.pdf” (interpretation + OKR/SMART notes)

---

## 3) Document takeaways (what we learned from the PDFs)

### 3.1 From *The Leader as Coach* (HBR)
Key relevance to MLQ:
- Strong linkage to **IC** (coaching/mentoring behaviors) and **IS** (asking questions that stimulate thinking).
- Emphasizes coaching behaviors such as:
  - listening, curiosity, open questions
  - helping others generate options (not providing the answer)
  - balancing directive vs non-directive behavior depending on context
- Useful to distinguish **healthy autonomy** from **LF (avoidance)**:
  - coaching can be non-directive *without being absent*.
- Provides practical coaching structures (e.g., GROW) that can become repeatable leadership habits.

### 3.2 From the instructor’s MLQ + OKR guidance
- Goals can be OKR or other  - **SMART is required**.
- In OKR terms:
  - **Objective** = directional intent
  - **Key Results** = measurable outcomes (not tasks)
  - **Actions/Initiatives** = what you do to achieve KRs
- Warning: if your “KR” reads like an activity (e.g., “analyze”, “help”, “consult”), it’s not a KR  - it’s an action.

## 4) Your MLQ results  - Means (Z-scores)

### 4.1 Table (Self vs Others)

|  | Idealized Influence (II) | Inspirational Motivation (IM) | Intellectual Stimulation (IS) | Individualized Consideration (IC) | Contingent Reward (CR) | MBEA (Active) | MBEP (Passive) | Laissez-Faire (LF) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| **Self** | -0.51 | 1.03 | 0.00 | -0.51 | 0.51 | -0.77 | 0.77 | 0.00 |
| **Colleagues+Manager** | 0.22 | 0.24 | 0.66 | 0.56 | 0.58 | -0.17 | -1.06 | -1.37 |

### 4.2 Biggest Self–Others gaps (Self – Others)
- **MBEP**: +1.83 (Self higher; others much lower)
- **LF**: +1.37 (Self higher; others much lower)
- **IC**: -1.07 (Self lower; others higher)
- **IM**: +0.79 (Self higher; others lower)
- **II**: -0.73 (Self lower; others higher)
- **IS**: -0.66 (Self lower; others higher)
- **MBEA**: -0.60 (Self lower; others higher)
- **CR**: -0.07 (almost aligned)

---

## 5) Your MLQ results  - Standard Deviations (Raters)

This is the “Graph 2” (SDs). With only **3 raters**, interpret cautiously, but it still provides signal about agreement.

Approximate SDs from the graph:
- **II** ~0.05 (very high agreement)
- **IM** ~0.14 (good agreement)
- **IS** ~0.49 (highest dispersion; close to 0.5 threshold)
- **IC** ~0.46 (high dispersion)
- **CR** ~0.29 (moderate)
- **MBEA** ~0.28 (moderate)
- **MBEP** ~0.44 (high dispersion)
- **LF** ~0.34 (moderate-high)

**Interpretation (as used in the assignment):**
- Overall: SDs appear **below 0.5**, implying acceptable agreement.
- Higher dispersion (IS/IC/MBEP) suggests context/exposure differences: different raters observe you differently.
- Small sample caveat: SDs are indicative.

---

## 6) Guided analysis  - Question-by-question (Q&A log)

### Q1: Where are the biggest Self vs Others gaps?
**Data shown:** table above + computed gaps.

**Your conclusions (summarized):**
- **II:** You don’t perceive yourself as particularly charismatic; you want to improve this. You noted that despite the gap, you believed both were low vs expectations.
- **IM:** You feel you talk a lot about the vision (at least internally). You see that it doesn’t fully translate to others.
- **IS:** You see yourself as non-challenging / “flowing with others,” but others see you as more challenging; you said it should be strengthened.
- **IC:** You were surprised others perceive you as a mentor given matrix leadership; you said you did not want to focus on IC.
- **CR:** Little to no gap; results are reasonable.
- **MBEA:** You think you need to improve early detection; as a PM it’s crucial; you perceive yourself lower than others; still a problem.
- **MBEP:** You often “clean the table after chaos”; you liked that others are not exposed; you view it positively that your cleanup is invisible.
- **LF:** You want to work on it; you avoid intervening sometimes; you felt there was alignment with others.

**Clarification we added:**
- Because these are **Z-scores**, some “low” statements needed precision:
  - For **II**, others are slightly above average (0.22), while your self is below average (-0.51).
  - For **LF**, you are at the mean (0.00), while others see you very low (-1.37). That’s a **large mismatch**, not alignment.

---

### Q2: What’s the overall picture “according to others”?
**Data shown:** rater means by category
- Transformational (II/IM/IS/IC): all positive, especially **IS** and **IC**
- Transactional (CR/MBEA): CR positive; MBEA slightly negative
- Passive/Avoidant (MBEP/LF): both strongly negative (very low)

**Your conclusion:**
- You are above average transformational, still room to improve.
- Others do not experience you as passive (positive).

---

### Q3: Which two gaps will you focus on (personal importance + leverage)?
You chose:
- **IM (Inspirational Motivation)**
- **MBEA (Active early detection)**

And you explicitly **did not** want to “fix” MBEP because you liked your behind-the-scenes cleanup behavior.

---

### Q4 (IM): Where does the message fail to transmit?
**Your answers:**
1) Audience: “sideways and upwards”  - when describing work you focus on **what**, not enough on **why** and long-term vision.
2) Format: mostly **1:1**; want to bring vision into bigger forums (e.g., status presentations).
3) Needed change: connect tasks/projects to the bigger vision; make the vision more reasoned/grounded.

**Success indicator you defined:**
- People propose initiatives and make decisions independently based on the vision (less dependence on you).

---

### Q5 (MBEA): What exceptions matter most in your context?
You chose:
- Scope
- Product metrics
- Schedule

Then you narrowed the biggest pain to:
- **Schedule**: tasks taking too long (developer work elongates) creates costly delays.

---

### Constraint / boundary: Avoid micromanagement
**Your red lines:**
- Do not intervene in solution approach or code.
- Do not request daily status updates.

We turned this into a guiding principle:
- Use MBEA via **risk questions, scope decisions, dependency removal, prioritization, escalation**, not technical interference.

---

### Implementation details shared
- Tool/process context: **Kanban** (and sometimes sprints), using **Linear**
- Task duration norm: a task should not take more than **4 days**
- Statuses: Backlog / Todo / In Progress / In Review / Done (+ canceled)
- You requested: **personal methods and self-development habits**, not a new workflow framework.

---

## 7) Updated requirements check (after the instructor email)

Instructor wrote:
- Interpretation guidance is attached.
- Methodology can be OKR or not; the key is **actions tied to goals**.
- Goals must be **SMART**.

We concluded:
- We are aligned on **two focus gaps** and an action plan direction.
- Needed improvements:
  - Add explicit **time bounds**
  - Add **measurable outcomes** (Key Results) instead of only actions
  - Use the SD graph briefly + acknowledge small N.

# 8) FINAL DRAFT (English)  - MLQ analysis + SMART/OKR-style development plan

## Individual Leadership Development Plan (MLQ – Full Range Leadership)

### 1. Context: My Role and the 360° Feedback Process

I currently work as a Product Manager in an early-stage startup building an agent-to-agent communication platform. I am the first PM in the company, working on the core product. Previously, I worked as a Product Manager at a large publicly traded company, where I owned a specific product within a broader suite. In both roles, my leadership is matrix-based -influence without direct line management -but the previous matrix was significantly larger and more structured.

The shift from a large organization to a startup has changed the nature of my work considerably: tighter scope, closer proximity to execution, and broader ownership. Despite the different scales, the common thread is leading through influence rather than authority.

**Respondent selection and limitations:**
I sent the MLQ questionnaire to colleagues from both my current and previous roles. Finding suitable respondents was challenging: my last manager at the corporate was my peer for most of our working relationship, and the remaining respondents are developers and stakeholders rather than fellow PMs. As a result, each respondent observes a different facet of my leadership - some see me in strategic discussions, others in day-to-day execution. This diversity of perspectives is reflected in some of the dispersion in the results.

The purpose of this document is to translate the MLQ 360° results into a focused improvement plan aimed at strengthening my transformational leadership, using SMART goals (and an OKR-like structure where appropriate).

---

### 2. Results Overview and Gaps Identified

#### 2.1 MLQ subscale means (Z-scores)
The MLQ results are presented as standardized scores (Z-scores) relative to a reference norm: positive values indicate above-average frequency, and negative values indicate below-average frequency.

**Self vs. Others (Colleagues + Manager):**
- II: Self -0.51 | Others 0.22  
- IM: Self 1.03 | Others 0.24  
- IS: Self 0.00 | Others 0.66  
- IC: Self -0.51 | Others 0.56  
- CR: Self 0.51 | Others 0.58  
- MBEA: Self -0.77 | Others -0.17  
- MBEP: Self 0.77 | Others -1.06  
- LF: Self 0.00 | Others -1.37  

#### 2.2 Interpretation (Full Range Leadership)
In the “ideal” Full Range Leadership profile, transformational leadership (II/IM/IS/IC) tends to be above average, contingent reward (CR) slightly positive, and passive/avoidant factors (MBEP/LF) very low. MBEA is typically low-to-moderate: used to detect and correct deviations early without becoming overly controlling.

**Overall picture (according to others):**
- Others perceive me as relatively strong on transformational leadership, especially IS and IC.
- Others perceive very low passive/avoidant leadership (low MBEP and very low LF), indicating that they do not experience me as disengaged.

**Key gaps:**
- **IM perception gap:** I rate my inspirational motivation much higher than others do, implying that my internal focus on vision and meaning may not consistently translate into a shared narrative externally.
- **MBEA shortfall:** I experience a shortfall in early detection and intervention, and while others rate me somewhat higher than I rate myself, both scores are below the norm -suggesting room to strengthen early risk detection in delivery.

#### 2.3 Standard deviation graph (agreement among raters)
The SD graph shows that dispersion is generally below the heuristic threshold of 0.5. This suggests acceptable agreement among raters, though some subscales show relatively higher dispersion (e.g., IS/IC/MBEP), likely reflecting differences in exposure or context. With only three raters, SD patterns are indicative rather than definitive.

---

### 3. Focus Areas Selected (and Why)

I selected two focus areas that are personally meaningful and high-leverage for my role:

1) **Inspirational Motivation (IM)**  
As a product leader, I want vision to function as a practical decision-making tool - not only a message. I want teammates and stakeholders to propose initiatives and make decisions aligned with the long-term direction without depending on me.

2) **Management-by-Exception Active (MBEA)**  
In product execution, schedule drift is expensive. I want to strengthen early detection and risk reduction without micromanaging - intervening through scope decisions, prioritization, dependency removal, and escalation (not through solution interference).

---

### 4. Transformation Plan (SMART / OKR-like)

## Objective 1 (IM): Make the vision a shared tool that increases autonomous decisions and initiatives

**Time-bound window:** 8–10 weeks

### Key Results (measurable outcomes)
- **KR1:** At least **2 decisions or priority choices per month** are made by *developers themselves* and explicitly justified using a shared "why/vision" principle (not only urgency or short-term constraints) - demonstrating that the vision has been internalized and inspires autonomous action.
- **KR2:** At least **1 instance per month** where a developer proactively proposes or re-prioritizes work based on the vision/long-term direction without being prompted.

### Personal Actions (habits)
1) **Weekly “Why + Long-Term Direction” closing ritual**  
   Once per week, at the end of the product + dev + CTO status meeting, I will close with a 60–90 second summary:
   - our purpose and the value we create for customers,
   - the longer-term direction,
   - and how the week’s priorities connect to that direction.

2) **1–2 explicit “line-of-sight” statements per week**  
   Each week I will choose 1–2 key topics and craft one sentence linking them to the long-term narrative: “We are doing X in order to enable Y.”

3) **A closing autonomy question**  
   At the end of major discussions I will ask: “What did we decide, and what in the vision/principle guided that decision?”  
   This reinforces that vision is used, not only heard.

**Success signal (qualitative):**
- More initiatives and decisions emerge from others that are already aligned with the vision (reduced dependency on me as the approval node).

---

## Objective 2 (MBEA): Reduce schedule surprises through early detection and immediate risk-reduction moves

**Time-bound window:** 8–10 weeks

### Key Results (measurable outcomes)
- **KR1:** Reduce the number of tasks that remain **In Progress > 4 days** by **50%** relative to baseline measured in week 1.
- **KR2:** Reduce the number of items in **triage > 3 weeks** by **70%** relative to baseline measured in week 1.

### Guardrails (anti-micromanagement)
My red lines are:
- I will not intervene in coding or solution design.
- I will not request daily status updates.
I will intervene only through: scope decomposition, prioritization, removing dependencies, clarifying acceptance criteria, and escalation.

### Personal Actions (habits)
1) **Exception-only scan (3 minutes)**
   Each morning, I will quickly scan only for the two exceptions:
   - In Progress > 4 days
   - triage > 3 weeks  
   This is not a daily status ritual - only exception visibility.

2) **Immediate decomposition + momentum**
   When an exception triggers, I will:
   - break the work into smaller deliverables,
   - tighten scope and acceptance criteria,
   - remove dependencies / escalate as needed,
   - and ensure immediate forward movement (including personal involvement in coordination -not in technical execution).

3) **One risk-focused question**
   When an exception triggers, I ask only:
   “What is the main blocker/risk, and what is the next step that reduces risk?”  
   I then act in my legitimate PM/leadership space (scope/priority/dependency/escalation), not in implementation.

---

### 5. Expected impact
If executed consistently, this plan should strengthen transformational leadership by making the “why” and long-term direction more visible and usable as a decision tool. In parallel, strengthening active early detection should reduce schedule surprises and improve predictability - without slipping into micromanagement.

## 9) To-do checklist for final submission (quick)
- [ ] Add organization / team / exact title (1 paragraph)
- [ ] Add course/semester deadline date (for Time-bound)
- [ ] Define baseline counts for KR1/KR2 in week 1 (MBEA)
- [ ] Define a 3-question pulse check for IM (baseline + target)
- [ ] Optional: add 2–3 sentences citing the “Leader as Coach” relevance (IC/IS and non-LF autonomy)
