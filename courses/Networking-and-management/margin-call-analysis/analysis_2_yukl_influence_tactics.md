# Yukl's Influence Tactics in Organizational Crisis: An Analysis of Scene 45 from "Margin Call"

## Introduction

Gary Yukl's framework of influence tactics provides a comprehensive lens for understanding how leaders and organizational members attempt to shape attitudes, behaviors, and decisions in workplace settings. According to Yukl (2001), influence tactics can be categorized into nine distinct approaches: rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, consultation, exchange, coalition, inspirational appeal, personal appeal, and ingratiation. Critically, the effectiveness of these tactics varies depending on the direction of influence—whether upward (toward superiors), downward (toward subordinates), or lateral (toward peers).

Scene 45 of "Margin Call" (2011) presents an exceptional case study for applying Yukl's framework. Set in the CEO's executive boardroom at approximately 4:00 AM, the scene depicts a pivotal moment during the 2008 financial crisis. CEO John Tuld has been summoned by helicopter after analyst Peter Sullivan discovered that the firm holds $1.215 trillion in toxic mortgage-backed securities—an exposure that, if left unaddressed, would exceed the company's market capitalization with only a 25% decline. The scene involves multiple influence attempts across all three directional vectors, culminating in Tuld's decision to execute an immediate fire sale of all toxic assets despite significant resistance from Sam Rogers, a 34-year veteran of the firm.

This analysis examines how various characters deploy Yukl's influence tactics, evaluates the effectiveness of each approach, and considers the theoretical implications for crisis leadership and organizational decision-making.

## Downward Influence: Tuld's Deployment of Multiple Tactics

### Tuld's Influence on Peter Sullivan

John Tuld's interaction with Peter Sullivan demonstrates a sophisticated combination of influence tactics designed to extract accurate information from a junior employee. When Tuld enters the boardroom, he immediately bypasses the chain of command to address Peter directly, stating: "Speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever. It wasn't brains that got me here, I can assure you of that."

This opening represents **ingratiation** combined with strategic self-deprecation. By positioning himself as intellectually subordinate to the MIT-trained analyst, Tuld reduces the power distance that might otherwise intimidate Peter into providing sanitized or incomplete information. Yukl (2001) notes that ingratiation is typically more effective in lateral and upward influence attempts; however, Tuld's deployment demonstrates that downward ingratiation can be strategically valuable when accurate information from subordinates is the primary goal.

Tuld further employs **consultation** by genuinely seeking Peter's expert assessment. He asks directly about the probability of the crisis scenario and listens intently to the response. This tactic acknowledges Peter's expertise and creates psychological safety for honest disclosure—a critical requirement when subordinates might otherwise be tempted to minimize bad news for self-protection.

### Tuld's Influence on Sam Rogers

The most complex influence dynamic in Scene 45 occurs between Tuld and Sam Rogers. Sam represents the primary obstacle to Tuld's fire sale strategy, objecting on ethical grounds: "You are selling something you know has no value." Tuld's response deploys multiple tactics in rapid succession.

First, Tuld employs **rational persuasion** through reframing. When Sam characterizes the plan as selling worthless assets, Tuld counters: "We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price." This logical argument attempts to neutralize the ethical objection by emphasizing that market prices, whatever they may be, represent voluntary transactions between informed parties. Research in the Leadership Quarterly has demonstrated that rational persuasion is among the most consistently effective influence tactics across organizational contexts (Falbe & Yukl, 1992), though its effectiveness diminishes when targets hold strong pre-existing beliefs—as Sam clearly does.

When rational persuasion fails to overcome Sam's resistance, Tuld escalates to **legitimating** tactics, invoking his formal authority as CEO. His statement "This is it, Sam, this is it!" combined with his physical intensity signals that the decision has been made and further debate is unwelcome. Legitimating tactics draw on position power and organizational hierarchy to establish that the influence agent has the right to make demands (Yukl, 2001). However, research suggests that legitimating alone rarely produces commitment—it more commonly yields compliance or, in worst cases, resistance (Yukl & Tracey, 1992).

Recognizing the limitations of pure authority, Tuld shifts to **pressure** tactics. By asking Sam "If I made you... how would you do it?", Tuld frames the fire sale as an inevitable reality, transforming a hypothetical into a mandate. This persistent pressure removes the option of non-compliance while technically maintaining the fiction of Sam's agency. The pressure intensifies through urgency framing: the meeting is at 4 AM, the decision must happen within hours, and delay is presented as existential risk.

Finally, Tuld deploys **exchange** tactics in a private conversation with Sam following the boardroom meeting. Though not fully depicted in Scene 45, the dialogue implies that Tuld offers Sam significant financial compensation to lead the fire sale personally. Exchange tactics involve offering tangible rewards in return for compliance (Yukl, 2001). Research indicates that exchange is moderately effective for gaining compliance but rarely produces genuine commitment to the requested action, as exchange creates transactional rather than transformational relationships (Yukl & Tracey, 1992).

### Coalition Tactics: The Silent Support Structure

Tuld's influence is bolstered by **coalition** tactics manifest in the meeting's composition. The boardroom contains legal counsel (Ramesh Shah), multiple senior executives, and board members who remain largely silent throughout the proceedings. Ramesh's confirmation that the fire sale is legal—"They can slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you"—provides legitimacy from an independent expert source. The silent presence of other senior leaders signals organizational consensus and isolates Sam as the sole voice of dissent.

Yukl (2001) describes coalition tactics as particularly effective when the target perceives that other respected organizational members support the influence attempt. By surrounding himself with apparent allies, Tuld increases the social cost of Sam's continued resistance.

## Lateral Influence: Jared Cohen and Sarah Robertson

The lateral influence dynamics between Jared Cohen and Sarah Robertson illustrate how Yukl's framework applies to peer relationships characterized by competition rather than collaboration.

Jared employs **coalition** and **legitimating** tactics in his positioning relative to Sarah. Before Tuld's arrival, Jared warns everyone to "tell the truth... no sugar coating," establishing himself as the voice of transparency. When asked about prior knowledge of the risk, Jared deflects with references to where he and Sarah "both stood on this all along"—a statement that implies shared awareness while positioning himself as having advocated for appropriate responses.

Sarah, by contrast, becomes increasingly defensive. The "loaded glances" exchanged between her and Jared suggest awareness that one of them will likely be scapegoated. In this context, influence becomes zero-sum: Jared's successful positioning as a responsible actor necessarily diminishes Sarah's perceived competence.

This lateral dynamic demonstrates that Yukl's framework, while primarily designed for understanding directed influence attempts, also illuminates defensive positioning and blame avoidance in organizational politics. Research in the Academy of Management Journal has shown that lateral influence in organizations is frequently competitive rather than cooperative, particularly in crisis situations where blame allocation is likely (Ferris et al., 2007).

## Upward Influence: Peter Sullivan's Presentation

Peter Sullivan's explanation of the crisis to Tuld represents a textbook case of upward influence through **rational persuasion**. Despite his junior status, Peter must convince the CEO that the firm faces an existential threat requiring immediate action.

Peter's approach emphasizes factual evidence and logical argumentation. He presents specific numbers—$1.215 trillion in MBS exposure, the 25% decline threshold, the two-week trend of increasing losses—without emotional embellishment. Yukl (2001) identifies rational persuasion as the most effective tactic for upward influence, particularly when the agent possesses technical expertise that the target lacks.

Peter also benefits from implicit **expert power**, a related but distinct concept. His MIT credentials and aerospace engineering background establish credibility that permits him to speak authoritatively despite his organizational position. Research suggests that upward influence attempts are most successful when agents can demonstrate unique expertise relevant to the influence objective (Yukl & Falbe, 1990).

Notably, Peter avoids tactics that would be inappropriate for upward influence. He does not attempt pressure, legitimating, or coalition tactics—all of which would be ineffective or counterproductive when targeting a superior. This selective deployment demonstrates sophisticated understanding of influence direction constraints, whether intuitive or deliberate.

## Effectiveness Analysis: Why Certain Tactics Prevailed

Several patterns emerge from analyzing which influence tactics proved most effective in Scene 45.

**Rational persuasion succeeded in establishing shared situational understanding.** Peter's upward influence attempt and Tuld's information-gathering succeeded because both parties relied on factual evidence and logical argumentation. The numbers were undeniable, the trend was clear, and the implications were calculable. When organizational members agree on facts, rational persuasion provides a common foundation for decision-making.

**Rational persuasion failed to overcome value-based resistance.** When Tuld attempted to persuade Sam that selling toxic assets was ethically acceptable, rational arguments proved insufficient. Sam's objection was fundamentally moral rather than factual; he understood the logic but rejected the values underlying the proposed action. Research in the Harvard Business Review has demonstrated that value-based resistance requires influence tactics that address underlying beliefs rather than surface-level arguments (Garvin & Roberto, 2005).

**Multiple tactics in combination proved more effective than single tactics.** Tuld's eventual success with Sam required the deployment of legitimating, pressure, exchange, and coalition tactics in concert. This finding aligns with Yukl's (2001) observation that influence attempts are most successful when agents deploy multiple compatible tactics rather than relying on a single approach.

**Position power amplified tactic effectiveness.** Tuld's legitimating and pressure tactics would have been far less effective if deployed by a peer or subordinate. His position as CEO provided the structural foundation upon which these tactics could operate. Conversely, Peter's rational persuasion succeeded partly because expert power compensated for his lack of position power.

**Crisis context elevated pressure and urgency framing.** The 4 AM timing, the helicopter arrival, and the repeated emphasis that "this is it" created a decision-making environment where deliberation appeared irresponsible. In crisis contexts, time pressure can transform pressure tactics from coercive to seemingly necessary—a dynamic with significant ethical implications.

**The distinction between compliance and commitment reveals the limits of coercive influence.** Yukl's research distinguishes between three possible outcomes of influence attempts: commitment (target agrees internally and will persist without supervision), compliance (target goes along but without enthusiasm), and resistance (target opposes the request). While Tuld successfully obtains Sam's compliance through the combination of legitimating, pressure, and exchange tactics, the scene makes clear this is not genuine commitment. Sam will execute the fire sale, but his body language, verbal resistance, and moral objections signal that he views the action as wrong. This compliance-without-commitment dynamic has important organizational implications: subordinates who comply under pressure may execute tasks competently but will not go beyond minimum requirements, may subtly undermine implementation, and will harbor resentment that damages future leader-follower relationships. Tuld's tactical victory thus comes at a relational cost that Yukl's framework helps us quantify and predict.

**The role of formal position in amplifying tactic effectiveness deserves particular attention.** Research by Yukl and Tracey (1992) demonstrates that the same influence tactic can produce markedly different outcomes depending on the agent's organizational position. Tuld's legitimating and pressure tactics succeed largely because his CEO role provides structural foundation—the same tactics deployed by a peer or subordinate would likely fail or backfire. This position-contingent effectiveness explains why Peter Sullivan relies exclusively on rational persuasion in his upward influence attempt: pressure or legitimating tactics would be not merely ineffective but actively counterproductive when directed at a superior. The scene thus illustrates that effective influence requires not only selecting appropriate tactics but also calibrating those selections to one's position in the organizational hierarchy.

## Conclusion

Scene 45 of "Margin Call" provides a remarkably rich illustration of Yukl's influence tactics operating across all three directional vectors simultaneously. CEO John Tuld demonstrates masterful deployment of downward influence, combining ingratiation, consultation, rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, exchange, and coalition tactics to extract information and overcome resistance. Jared Cohen and Sarah Robertson engage in competitive lateral positioning that will ultimately determine who bears responsibility for the firm's exposure. Peter Sullivan executes effective upward influence through rational persuasion grounded in expert credibility.

The scene's outcome—Tuld's successful implementation of the fire sale despite Sam's ethical objections—illustrates both the power and limitations of Yukl's framework. Position power, time pressure, and multi-tactic deployment can produce behavioral compliance even when genuine commitment is absent. Sam will execute the fire sale, but his resistance signals that compliance achieved through pressure and exchange rarely produces the internalized commitment that organizations need for sustained performance.

From a theoretical perspective, Scene 45 suggests that crisis contexts fundamentally alter the calculus of influence effectiveness. Tactics that might be inappropriate or ineffective under normal circumstances—particularly pressure and legitimating—become more viable when urgency is genuine and stakes are existential. However, this crisis amplification also raises ethical questions about whether compliance achieved under such conditions represents legitimate organizational decision-making or coerced capitulation.

Future research might examine how influence tactics interact with crisis severity, time pressure, and ethical salience to produce different commitment outcomes. Additionally, the role of value-based resistance as a moderator of influence effectiveness deserves greater attention in organizational behavior scholarship.
