# Yukl's Influence Tactics in Organizational Crisis: An Analysis of Scene 45 from "Margin Call"

## Introduction

Gary Yukl's framework identifies nine influence tactics: rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, consultation, exchange, coalition, inspirational appeal, personal appeal, and ingratiation. The effectiveness of these tactics varies by direction of influence—upward, downward, or lateral—and the relationship between parties.

## Downward Influence: Tuld's Deployment of Multiple Tactics

### Tuld's Influence on Peter Sullivan

John Tuld's interaction with Peter Sullivan demonstrates a sophisticated combination of tactics to extract accurate information from a junior employee. When Tuld enters the boardroom, he states: "Speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever. It wasn't brains that got me here, I can assure you of that."

This represents **ingratiation** through strategic self-deprecation. By positioning himself as intellectually subordinate to the MIT-trained analyst, Tuld reduces the power distance that might intimidate Peter into providing incomplete information. While ingratiation is typically more effective in lateral and upward attempts, Tuld's deployment shows it can be valuable downward when accurate information is the goal.

Tuld further employs **consultation** by genuinely seeking Peter's expert assessment, acknowledging his expertise and creating psychological safety for honest disclosure.

Tuld also deploys **legitimating** when Peter hesitates and looks to Jared for approval. Tuld immediately intervenes: "You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan." This asserts his authority as CEO to bypass normal hierarchy and receive unfiltered information directly.

### Tuld's Influence on Sam Rogers

The most complex influence dynamic occurs between Tuld and Sam Rogers, who objects to the fire sale on ethical grounds: "You are selling something you know has no value."

First, Tuld employs **rational persuasion** through reframing: "We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price." This attempts to neutralize the ethical objection by emphasizing voluntary transactions. However, rational persuasion's effectiveness diminishes when targets hold strong pre-existing beliefs.

When this fails, Tuld escalates to **legitimating** tactics. His statement "This is it, Sam, this is it!" signals that the decision has been made. Yet legitimating alone rarely produces commitment—it typically yields compliance or resistance.

Tuld then shifts to **pressure** tactics. By asking "If I made you... how would you do it?", he frames the fire sale as inevitable, removing the option of non-compliance while maintaining the fiction of Sam's agency.

Notably, these tactics prove insufficient. In Scene 55, Tuld hands Sam a compensation offer. Sam responds: "That's very generous." Tuld replies: "It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this." This **exchange** tactic represents Tuld's final tool to overcome resistance—demonstrating that even a CEO's authority may be insufficient against deeply held moral objections.

### Coalition Tactics: The Silent Support Structure

Tuld's influence is bolstered by **coalition** tactics. The boardroom contains legal counsel, senior executives, and board members who remain largely silent. Ramesh Shah's confirmation that the fire sale is legal provides independent legitimacy, while the silent presence of senior leaders signals consensus and isolates Sam as the sole dissenter.

## Upward Influence: Peter Sullivan and Sam Rogers

Peter Sullivan's crisis explanation represents a textbook case of upward influence through **rational persuasion**. He presents specific numbers—$1.215 trillion in MBS exposure, the 25% decline threshold—without emotional embellishment. Rational persuasion is most effective for upward influence when the agent possesses technical expertise the target lacks.

Peter also benefits from **expert power**. His MIT credentials establish credibility that permits authoritative speech despite his junior position. Notably, he avoids tactics inappropriate for upward influence—pressure, legitimating, or coalition—demonstrating sophisticated understanding of influence direction constraints.

### Sam Rogers's Failed Upward Influence on Tuld

Sam also attempts upward influence through **rational persuasion**: "If you do this you've killed that market for years," and "You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again." His arguments are well-constructed, but fail because Tuld has already decided based on survival priorities.

This illustrates a key limitation: when the target holds different fundamental values, logical arguments alone cannot bridge the gap. Rational persuasion is most effective when agent and target share underlying assumptions—a condition not met here.

## Effectiveness Analysis

**Rational persuasion succeeded for establishing shared facts** but **failed against value-based resistance.** Peter's numbers were undeniable; Sam's moral objections were not about facts but values. Logical arguments cannot bridge fundamental value differences.

**Multiple tactics outperformed single tactics.** Tuld needed rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, coalition, and ultimately exchange—deployed across two scenes—to secure Sam's cooperation.

**Position power amplified effectiveness.** Tuld's CEO role provided structural foundation for legitimating and pressure tactics; Peter's expert power compensated for his lack of position power.

**Crisis context elevated pressure tactics.** The 4 AM timing and repeated "this is it" framing made deliberation appear irresponsible.

**Compliance differs from commitment.** Tuld obtains Sam's compliance but not commitment—Sam will execute the fire sale but views it as wrong. This compliance-without-commitment has organizational costs: minimal effort, potential subtle undermining, and damaged relationships.

## Conclusion

Scene 45 illustrates Yukl's influence tactics in both directions. Tuld combines ingratiation, consultation, and legitimating with Peter, and rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, coalition, and exchange with Sam. Peter executes effective upward influence through rational persuasion grounded in expertise, while Sam's upward attempt fails due to value differences.

The outcome—successful fire sale implementation despite ethical objections—shows both the power and limits of these tactics. Position power, time pressure, and multi-tactic deployment can produce compliance even without commitment. Sam will execute the plan, but his resistance signals that pressure-achieved compliance rarely produces the internalized commitment organizations need.
