# Yukl's Influence Tactics in Organizational Crisis: An Analysis of Scene 45 from "Margin Call"

## Introduction

Gary Yukl's framework of influence tactics provides a comprehensive lens for understanding how leaders and organizational members attempt to shape attitudes, behaviors, and decisions in workplace settings. According to Yukl, influence tactics can be categorized into nine distinct approaches: rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, consultation, exchange, coalition, inspirational appeal, personal appeal, and ingratiation. Critically, the effectiveness of these tactics varies depending on the direction of influence—whether upward (toward superiors), downward (toward subordinates), or lateral (toward peers)—the nature of the relationship between the parties, and the specific subject matter under discussion.

## Downward Influence: Tuld's Deployment of Multiple Tactics

### Tuld's Influence on Peter Sullivan

John Tuld's interaction with Peter Sullivan demonstrates a sophisticated combination of influence tactics designed to extract accurate information from a junior employee. When Tuld enters the boardroom, he immediately bypasses the chain of command to address Peter directly, stating: "Speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever. It wasn't brains that got me here, I can assure you of that."

This opening represents **ingratiation** combined with strategic self-deprecation. By positioning himself as intellectually subordinate to the MIT-trained analyst, Tuld reduces the power distance that might otherwise intimidate Peter into providing sanitized or incomplete information. Yukl notes that ingratiation is typically more effective in lateral and upward influence attempts; however, Tuld's deployment demonstrates that downward ingratiation can be strategically valuable when accurate information from subordinates is the primary goal.

Tuld further employs **consultation** by genuinely seeking Peter's expert assessment. He asks directly about the probability of the crisis scenario and listens intently to the response. This tactic acknowledges Peter's expertise and creates psychological safety for honest disclosure—a critical requirement when subordinates might otherwise be tempted to minimize bad news for self-protection.

Tuld also deploys **legitimating** to ensure Peter reports directly to him rather than filtering information through the chain of command. At a critical moment, when Peter is about to reveal the catastrophic loss projection, he hesitates and looks down at Jared for approval to continue. Tuld immediately intervenes: "You're speaking with me Mr. Sullivan." This legitimating tactic asserts Tuld's authority as CEO to bypass the normal hierarchy and receive unfiltered information directly from the analyst who discovered the problem. By overriding Peter's instinct to defer to his immediate superiors, Tuld ensures he receives the full, unvarnished truth.

### Tuld's Influence on Sam Rogers

The most complex influence dynamic in Scene 45 occurs between Tuld and Sam Rogers. Sam represents the primary obstacle to Tuld's fire sale strategy, objecting on ethical grounds: "You are selling something you know has no value." Tuld's response deploys multiple tactics in rapid succession.

First, Tuld employs **rational persuasion** through reframing. When Sam characterizes the plan as selling worthless assets, Tuld counters: "We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price." This logical argument attempts to neutralize the ethical objection by emphasizing that market prices, whatever they may be, represent voluntary transactions between informed parties. Research has demonstrated that rational persuasion is moderately effective across organizational contexts and is particularly useful for establishing shared understanding of facts and situations (Falbe & Yukl, 1992), though its effectiveness diminishes when targets hold strong pre-existing beliefs—as Sam clearly does.

When rational persuasion fails to overcome Sam's resistance, Tuld escalates to **legitimating** tactics, invoking his formal authority as CEO. His statement "This is it, Sam, this is it!" combined with his physical intensity signals that the decision has been made and further debate is unwelcome. Legitimating tactics draw on position power and organizational hierarchy to establish that the influence agent has the right to make demands (Yukl, 2001). However, research suggests that legitimating alone rarely produces commitment—it more commonly yields compliance or, in worst cases, resistance (Yukl & Tracey, 1992).

Recognizing the limitations of pure authority, Tuld shifts to **pressure** tactics. By asking Sam "If I made you... how would you do it?", Tuld frames the fire sale as an inevitable reality, transforming a hypothetical into a mandate. This persistent pressure removes the option of non-compliance while technically maintaining the fiction of Sam's agency. The pressure intensifies through urgency framing: the meeting is at 4 AM, the decision must happen within hours, and delay is presented as existential risk.

Notably, the tactics deployed in Scene 45 prove insufficient to secure Sam's full cooperation. Tuld must resort to an additional tactic in a later scene (Scene 55), when he confronts Sam in the bathroom and hands him a piece of paper with a compensation offer. Sam responds: "That's very generous." Tuld replies: "It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this." This **exchange** tactic—offering tangible rewards in return for compliance (Yukl, 2001)—represents Tuld's final tool to overcome Sam's resistance. Research indicates that exchange is moderately effective for gaining compliance but rarely produces genuine commitment to the requested action, as exchange creates transactional rather than transformational relationships (Yukl & Tracey, 1992). The fact that Tuld needed to deploy this additional tactic outside the boardroom demonstrates that even a CEO's authority, combined with pressure and coalition support, may be insufficient when facing deeply held moral objections.

### Coalition Tactics: The Silent Support Structure

Tuld's influence is bolstered by **coalition** tactics manifest in the meeting's composition. The boardroom contains legal counsel (Ramesh Shah), multiple senior executives, and board members who remain largely silent throughout the proceedings. Ramesh's confirmation that the fire sale is legal—"They can slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you"—provides legitimacy from an independent expert source. The silent presence of other senior leaders signals organizational consensus and isolates Sam as the sole voice of dissent.

Yukl describes coalition tactics as particularly effective when the target perceives that other respected organizational members support the influence attempt. By surrounding himself with apparent allies, Tuld increases the social cost of Sam's continued resistance.

## Upward Influence: Peter Sullivan and Sam Rogers

Peter Sullivan's explanation of the crisis to Tuld represents a textbook case of upward influence through **rational persuasion**. Despite his junior status, Peter must convince the CEO that the firm faces an existential threat requiring immediate action.

Peter's approach emphasizes factual evidence and logical argumentation. He presents specific numbers—$1.215 trillion in MBS exposure, the 25% decline threshold, the two-week trend of increasing losses—without emotional embellishment. Yukl identifies rational persuasion as the most effective tactic for upward influence, particularly when the agent possesses technical expertise that the target lacks.

Peter also benefits from implicit **expert power**, a related but distinct concept. His MIT credentials and aerospace engineering background establish credibility that permits him to speak authoritatively despite his organizational position. Research suggests that upward influence attempts are most successful when agents can demonstrate unique expertise relevant to the influence objective (Yukl & Falbe, 1990).

Notably, Peter avoids tactics that would be inappropriate for upward influence. He does not attempt pressure, legitimating, or coalition tactics—all of which would be ineffective or counterproductive when targeting a superior. This selective deployment demonstrates sophisticated understanding of influence direction constraints, whether intuitive or deliberate.

### Sam Rogers's Failed Upward Influence on Tuld

Sam Rogers also attempts upward influence on Tuld through **rational persuasion**, but unlike Peter's successful attempt, Sam's fails. Sam presents logical and ethical arguments against the fire sale: "If you do this you've killed that market for years. It's over," "You are selling something you know has no value," and "You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again."

Sam's rational persuasion attempts are well-constructed: he presents factual consequences (destroyed market relationships, regulatory scrutiny) and ethical objections (selling worthless assets to trusting counterparties). However, his influence attempt fails because Tuld has already made his decision based on survival priorities. Tuld's counter-argument—"We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price"—reframes the ethical issue, and his legitimating response—"This is it, Sam, this is it!"—signals that further debate is unwelcome.

This failed upward influence attempt illustrates a key limitation of rational persuasion: when the target holds different fundamental values or priorities, logical arguments alone cannot bridge the gap. Sam's objections are moral rather than factual, and Tuld's survival-focused calculus simply assigns different weights to the ethical considerations Sam raises. As Yukl's research suggests, rational persuasion is most effective when agent and target share underlying assumptions—a condition not met in this interaction.

## Effectiveness Analysis: Why Certain Tactics Prevailed

Several patterns emerge from analyzing which influence tactics proved most effective in Scene 45.

**Rational persuasion succeeded in establishing shared situational understanding.** Peter's upward influence attempt and Tuld's information-gathering succeeded because both parties relied on factual evidence and logical argumentation. The numbers were undeniable, the trend was clear, and the implications were calculable. When organizational members agree on facts, rational persuasion provides a common foundation for decision-making.

**Rational persuasion failed to overcome value-based resistance.** When Tuld attempted to persuade Sam that selling toxic assets was ethically acceptable, rational arguments proved insufficient. Sam's objection was fundamentally moral rather than factual; he understood the logic but rejected the values underlying the proposed action. This illustrates a key limitation of rational persuasion: when resistance is rooted in deeply held values rather than factual disagreement, logical arguments alone cannot bridge the gap. Effective influence in such situations requires tactics that address underlying beliefs and emotional commitments rather than surface-level arguments.

**Multiple tactics in combination proved more effective than single tactics.** Tuld's eventual success with Sam required the deployment of rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, coalition, and ultimately exchange tactics in concert. Significantly, the tactics deployed within Scene 45 proved insufficient—Tuld needed to deploy the exchange tactic in a subsequent scene (Scene 55) to finally secure Sam's cooperation. This finding aligns with Yukl's observation that influence attempts are most successful when agents deploy multiple compatible tactics rather than relying on a single approach.

**Position power amplified tactic effectiveness.** Tuld's legitimating and pressure tactics would have been far less effective if deployed by a peer or subordinate. His position as CEO provided the structural foundation upon which these tactics could operate. Conversely, Peter's rational persuasion succeeded partly because expert power compensated for his lack of position power.

**Crisis context elevated pressure and urgency framing.** The 4 AM timing, the helicopter arrival, and the repeated emphasis that "this is it" created a decision-making environment where deliberation appeared irresponsible. In crisis contexts, time pressure can transform pressure tactics from coercive to seemingly necessary—a dynamic with significant ethical implications.

**The distinction between compliance and commitment reveals the limits of coercive influence.** Yukl's research distinguishes between three possible outcomes of influence attempts: commitment (target agrees internally and will persist without supervision), compliance (target goes along but without enthusiasm), and resistance (target opposes the request). While Tuld successfully obtains Sam's compliance through the combination of legitimating, pressure, and exchange tactics, the scene makes clear this is not genuine commitment. Sam will execute the fire sale, but his body language, verbal resistance, and moral objections signal that he views the action as wrong. This compliance-without-commitment dynamic has important organizational implications: subordinates who comply under pressure may execute tasks competently but will not go beyond minimum requirements, may subtly undermine implementation, and will harbor resentment that damages future leader-follower relationships. Tuld's tactical victory thus comes at a relational cost that Yukl's framework helps us quantify and predict.

**The role of formal position in amplifying tactic effectiveness deserves particular attention.** Research by Yukl and Tracey (1992) demonstrates that the same influence tactic can produce markedly different outcomes depending on the agent's organizational position. Tuld's legitimating and pressure tactics succeed largely because his CEO role provides structural foundation—the same tactics deployed by a peer or subordinate would likely fail or backfire. This position-contingent effectiveness explains why Peter Sullivan relies exclusively on rational persuasion in his upward influence attempt: pressure or legitimating tactics would be not merely ineffective but actively counterproductive when directed at a superior. The scene thus illustrates that effective influence requires not only selecting appropriate tactics but also calibrating those selections to one's position in the organizational hierarchy.

## Conclusion

Scene 45 of "Margin Call" provides a remarkably rich illustration of Yukl's influence tactics operating in both downward and upward directions. CEO John Tuld demonstrates masterful deployment of downward influence, combining ingratiation, consultation, and legitimating (with Peter Sullivan) and rational persuasion, legitimating, pressure, and coalition tactics (with Sam Rogers). When these tactics prove insufficient within Scene 45, Tuld must deploy an additional exchange tactic in a later scene (Scene 55) to secure Sam's cooperation. Peter Sullivan executes effective upward influence through rational persuasion grounded in expert credibility, while Sam Rogers's upward influence attempt through rational persuasion fails due to fundamental value differences with Tuld.

The scene's outcome—Tuld's successful implementation of the fire sale despite Sam's ethical objections—illustrates both the power and limitations of Yukl's framework. Position power, time pressure, and multi-tactic deployment can produce behavioral compliance even when genuine commitment is absent. Sam will execute the fire sale, but his resistance signals that compliance achieved through pressure and exchange rarely produces the internalized commitment that organizations need for sustained performance.
