## Presentation Speaking Notes

**Opening Hook:**
"Imagine telling your grandmother she never has to wait for help to get to the kitchen again. Imagine knowing your father's vital signs are being monitored around the clock, even from 1,000 miles away. That's what MobilityPro makes possible."

**Problem Statement:**
"65 million people worldwide need wheelchairs. The population is aging rapidly. Caregivers are in short supply. Traditional wheelchairs make users dependent on others for every trip, every movement. Meanwhile, health issues go undetected until they become emergencies."

**Solution:**
"AutoGlide - a wheelchair that navigates itself to any destination the user selects, while continuously monitoring their vital signs and alerting caregivers to any concerns. Independence for users. Peace of mind for families."

**Business Case:**
"Healthcare is moving to remote monitoring - and it's reimbursable. Nursing homes need efficiency. Families want their loved ones to age safely at home. We address all three with hardware sales plus recurring subscription revenue."

**Differentiator:**
"Research labs have built autonomous wheelchairs. Medical device companies make health monitors. Nobody has commercialized both in one integrated, healthcare-ready platform. Until now."

**Close:**
"MobilityPro Health: Independence. Dignity. Peace of mind. For users. For caregivers. For families. Vote for the future of healthy aging."
