## Presentation Speaking Notes

**Opening Hook:**
"40,000 people bought tickets to last night's game. But how many were actually in their seats for the opening kickoff? How many left at halftime and never came back? Traditional venues have no idea. VenueIQ changes that."

**Problem Statement:**
"Venues invest millions in physical infrastructure but fly blind on how it's actually used. They can't prove attendance to sponsors. They guess at concession placement. They heat empty sections while packed areas swelter."

**Solution:**
"SenseSeats - intelligent seating that knows when fans arrive, when they leave, and how engaged they are. Plus haptic feedback that makes premium seats FEEL premium."

**Business Case:**
"The smart stadium market is $20 billion and growing 16% annually. Venues are desperate to optimize post-pandemic. We sell hardware, then recurring platform subscriptions, then data services. That's triple revenue from one relationship."

**Differentiator:**
"Big tech offers network infrastructure. Traditional manufacturers offer quality seats. VenueIQ offers both - and the data layer that turns seating into strategy."

**Close:**
"Every seat tells a story. Let VenueIQ help venues read it. Vote for the future of live entertainment."
