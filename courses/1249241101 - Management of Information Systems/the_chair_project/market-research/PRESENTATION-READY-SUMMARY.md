## Sample 200-Word Pitch (Option 1 - NestTech)

**NestTech Innovations presents NestPod Pro** - the world's first fully modular smart baby seating system.

Parents currently buy separate car seats, strollers, high chairs, and rockers - spending $2,000+ on products that don't communicate with each other. NestPod Pro is ONE intelligent seat that transforms between all four functions with interchangeable bases.

**Smart data collection** makes NestPod Pro more than furniture:
- **Breathing sensors** alert parents if baby's breathing pauses for more than 20 seconds
- **Temperature monitoring** prevents overheating, a leading cause of infant discomfort
- **Position tracking** detects unsafe rollover positions and tracks sleep patterns
- **Installation verification** confirms the car seat is correctly angled and secured
- **AI cry analysis** tells parents whether baby is hungry, tired, or uncomfortable

**Our business model** combines premium hardware sales (NestPod Pro at $699 plus accessory bases) with a NestCare+ subscription ($9.99/month) for extended warranty and premium app features. We also target the B2B daycare market with enterprise packages including volume discounts and staff training.

The baby car seat market alone is $31 billion. NestTech combines Doona's convenience innovation with 4moms' technology approach, plus recurring subscription revenue they never had.

**NestTech: One Seat. Every Journey.**
