**Email 2: Setup Tips (Day 2)**

Subject: 3 things new NestPod parents should know

Hi [Name],

By now you've probably clicked NestPod Pro in and out of a few bases. Here are pro tips from our team:

**Tip 1: The Green Light Game**
When you install the car seat, wait for the green light on top. It means angle and attachment are perfect. No green? The app will tell you exactly what to adjust.

**Tip 2: Charge While You Sleep**
Drop NestPod on the wireless charger overnight. 72 hours of battery means you'll never worry during a day trip.

**Tip 3: Add Your Co-Parent**
In the app, tap Settings > Family > Invite. Now both of you get alerts and see sleep data.

Happy parenting,
The NestTech Team
