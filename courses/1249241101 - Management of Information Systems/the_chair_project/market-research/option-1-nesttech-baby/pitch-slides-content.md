## Presentation Speaking Notes

**Opening Hook:**
"What if you never had to buy a separate car seat, stroller, high chair, AND rocker? What if ONE smart seat did it all - and kept your baby safer while you slept?"

**Problem Statement:**
"New parents spend $2,000+ on multiple seating products. They're heavy, bulky, and don't talk to each other. Meanwhile, parents worry constantly about safety."

**Solution:**
"NestPod Pro - one universal seat that transforms with interchangeable bases. Plus, integrated sensors that monitor your baby's safety and comfort 24/7."

**Differentiator:**
"Doona proved parents want convenience. We add intelligence. 4moms proved parents want technology. We add modularity. NestTech combines the best of both worlds."

**Business Case:**
"The baby car seat market alone is $31 billion. Parents spend premium for safety and convenience. Our subscription model creates recurring revenue that mattress companies like Casper never had."

**Close:**
"NestTech Innovations: We're not just making a chair. We're building peace of mind. Vote for the future of parenting."
