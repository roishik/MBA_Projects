# Smart Chair Business Model Presentation

Work together with your group to create a presentation of your business model.

## About this task

A traditional chair company, **Comfy Chairs Ltd**, has gone into administration. It's been bought out by a group of venture capitalists (**your team!**) who see value in the existing premises and equipment, and who plan to turn the company around by re-branding it and developing a **smart chair**.

"Smart" is a term often used to describe an artifact that has the ability to connect to the internet, such as smart TV, smart fridge, smart home, etc. Smart artifacts collect data using sensors that can be used to improve the user experience or fulfill a business need.

## Instructions

Use the **Meet your group** forum (in the Welcome section) to schedule an initial meeting for around **1 hour early this week**. If your group has agreed on an alternative method of communication, feel free to use that.

Once your team has decided on a smart chair and a business model, you will create a pitch to convince other investors (the other teams) to vote for it as the best business idea. You may need to schedule further meetings up to **Thursday** to discuss your ideas.

Before you meet your team, prepare at least one idea for a smart chair (see below for ideas). In your team, make the following decisions:

- **What is your new company name?**
  You need to rebrand the company, so choose a cool new name for it.

- **What type of smart chair will you develop?**
  A baby chair, a car seat, a theatre seat, a public bench, an airplane seat, or another type of chair?
  **Do not pick an office (or home office) chair** as this is too obvious! Be creative, but also think about feasibility!

- **What is your product name?**
  Choose an appropriate name for your chair.

- **What data will your chair collect?**
  Consider how data could be used to improve the user experience or to fulfill a business need.
  For example, a home office chair for employees working from home could use movement sensors to collect data about how often it is used during the workday, or it could use temperature sensors to trigger inbuilt cooling fans if the room gets too hot.

- **What is your business model?**
  How does your company plan to make money? Think about **B2B vs. B2C** as well as other potential revenue streams. Your investors will be interested in feasibility and business potential.

## Presentation requirements

Prepare a **1–2 slide Power Point presentation**, pitching your chair to investors (your classmates in the other groups). Focus on convincing them to vote for your company as having the best idea and business model.

In your slides, include:

- Your company name
- Which smart chair you picked
- The name of the chair
- The data the smart chair collects (and why)
- Your business model

Submit your presentation **by midnight on Sunday**. There are several activities to complete based on this activity, so it's important that your group submits the presentation by the deadline so that you can move on to the follow-up activities.
