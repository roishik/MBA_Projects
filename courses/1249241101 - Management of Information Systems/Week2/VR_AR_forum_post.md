# Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality: Unusual Industry Applications

## Two Surprising VR Examples

**1. Prison Rehabilitation**

California prisons are using VR as "hope machines" to prepare inmates for reentry into society. Inmates practice job interviews with virtual interviewers and learn everyday tasks they may have missed during long sentences—using ATMs, self-checkout machines, and navigating busy streets. In Michigan, 82% of inmates who used VR job interview training landed a job within six months, compared to 69% without it. This demonstrates how VR can bridge the gap between incarceration and successful reintegration.

**2. Courtroom Evidence Visualization**

Lawyers now use VR to recreate crime scenes, allowing jurors to "walk through" and examine evidence from multiple angles. In a Florida stand-your-ground case, Judge Andrew Siegel wore a Meta Quest 2 headset to experience the defendant's perspective—believed to be the first documented VR use in a U.S. courtroom. China conducted its first "metaverse trial" in 2022.

## One Surprising AR Example

**Wine Tasting**

"19 Crimes" wine labels come to life through AR—historical convicts depicted on the label tell their personal stories when viewed through a smartphone. Tooth & Nail winery features AR labels with music composed specifically for each wine experience. Virtual sommeliers like SippClub provide tasting tips, optimal serving temperatures, and food pairings through AR.
