# Adidas Case Study: CRM and Digital Transformation

## Question 2: Adidas's Business Strategy and CRM's Role

### Business Strategy
1. **Customer-Centric Differentiation:** Adidas does not compete on price but on the quality of its brand and customer experience.

2. **Digital-First Approach:** Transition from brick-and-mortar to digital as the preferred shopping medium.

3. **Personalized Customer Relationships:** The company wants a relationship with customers that is more personal than competitors like Amazon.

4. **Omnichannel Experience:** Providing connected and personalized customer experiences across all channels (website, mobile, email, social media, telephone).

### Role of CRM in Strategy
- **Central to Business:** Customers are clearly at the center of Adidas's business.
- **Competitive Differentiation:** CRM helps differentiate Adidas from competitors and leads to increased sales.
- **Individual Customer Knowledge:** CRM allows Adidas to answer: "Who is this person? How much do we know about that individual? Where did that person come from? What is that person interested in?
- **One-to-One Connection:** Adidas can now connect one-to-one with every customer, across multiple channels and on any device.

**Quote from Jacqueline Smith-Dubendorfer, Adidas Vice President of Digital Experience Design:**
> "Using Salesforce for customer relationship management has enhanced the company's ability to treat each customer as an individual."
