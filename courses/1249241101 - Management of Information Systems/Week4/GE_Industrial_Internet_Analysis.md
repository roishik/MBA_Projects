# GE and the Industrial Internet - Analysis Report

## What Was GE's Business Before the Transformation?

GE was primarily an industrial manufacturer with close to $146 billion in annual revenues in 2013. Its core business was designing and selling heavy capital equipment ("big iron"): aircraft engines, locomotives, turbines, generators, and medical imaging devices. Alongside hardware sales, GE earned recurring revenue through Contract Service Agreements (CSAs) - "break-fix" maintenance contracts covering preventative upkeep and repairs for equipment lifespans spanning decades. By 2013, services accounted for roughly 75% of industrial earnings.

## How Did GE Plan to Change Their Product?

GE's Industrial Internet initiative aimed to transform products from standalone machines into "smart," network-connected assets. The plan: (1) embed sensors and software into machines to collect operational data continuously; (2) connect machines to the cloud via the Predix platform; (3) apply analytics and predictive algorithms for real-time insights; and (4) shift from selling hardware with break-fix contracts to outcomes-based services - guaranteeing measurable performance improvements and sharing in value created. GE planned to evolve from a product company into a product-plus-services-plus-analytics company.

## Digital Transformation Assessment (9 Elements Framework)

| Element | Planned? | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **Customer Understanding** | Yes | Machine data and analytics to understand customer operations and efficiency opportunities. |
| **Top-line Growth** | Yes | New revenue from Predictivity solutions and outcome-based deals - projected $1.2B by 2014. |
| **Customer Touch Points** | Yes | Shift to digital interfaces: remote monitoring dashboards and Predix platform access. |
| **Process Digitization** | Yes | Connecting machines via sensors, cloud computing, and Predix platform. |
| **Worker Enablement** | Yes | Created GE Software center (350+ employees), retrained salesforce to solution-based sellers. |
| **Performance Management** | Yes | Real-time analytics dashboards, predictive maintenance replacing reactive break-fix. |
| **Digitally-Modified Business** | Yes | CSA contracts enhanced with software, shifting to outcome-guarantee agreements. |
| **New Digital Business** | Yes | Predictivity products, Predix platform-as-a-service, joint ventures (Taleris, Caradigm). |
| **Digital Globalization** | Partially | Global platform with partners (Intel, Cisco, AWS), though case focuses on U.S. rollout. |

GE planned comprehensive transformation across virtually all nine elements.

## Key Risks

- **Cannibalization**: Software offerings could erode existing high-margin hardware and CSA revenue streams.
- **Cultural Resistance**: 99% of salesforce trained to sell "big iron," not outcomes-based software. Legacy "build-and-ship-boxes" mentality posed barriers.
- **Competitive Threat**: IBM, Google, Siemens, and startups entering the space with deeper analytics expertise.
- **Customer Readiness**: Only 13% of customers used machine data for competitive advantage; 63% performed no condition-based maintenance.
- **Data Security & Liability**: Connecting mission-critical machines raised security, IP ownership, and liability concerns.
- **Monetization Uncertainty**: Pricing outcomes-based services proved difficult - quantifying value was "very hard to measure."
