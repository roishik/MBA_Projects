# EIS Implementation Strategy - Draft Plans
## Applying Cialdini's Principles of Influence to Organizational Change

---

# PLAN A: "The Champion Network Strategy"

## Core Philosophy
This strategy centers on identifying and developing **internal champions** early in the process. Rather than positioning yourself as the primary advocate for EIS, you cultivate managers who will become passionate advocates themselves. This leverages Cialdini's principles of **Commitment & Consistency** (champions who advocate publicly become increasingly committed) and **Unity** (peer-to-peer influence carries more weight than external pressure).

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Champion Development Principle
Cialdini's research on Commitment & Consistency reveals that when individuals take public positions, they become psychologically invested in those positions. By asking managers to lead workshops or present to peers, you transform passive recipients into active advocates. Their public commitment creates internal pressure to remain consistent with their stated views.

### Unity Through Co-Creation
Cialdini's seventh principle, Unity, emphasizes that people are influenced by those they perceive as part of "us." Champions who emerge from within Teleswitches carry inherent credibility that no external consultant can match. As Cialdini notes, "It's not just being like you but being one of you."

## Phase 1: Intelligence & Relationship Building (Days 1-25)

### Objectives
- Map the organizational landscape (networks, influencers, resistors)
- Begin building reciprocity with key players
- Identify potential champion candidates

### Initiative Sequence

| Day | Initiative | Target | Cialdini Principle | Purpose |
|-----|------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 1-3 | TASK FORCES | All | Unity | Identify existing tribal structures |
| 1-3 | COFFEE GROUPS | All | Social Proof, Unity | Map informal influence networks |
| 4-8 | NETWORKS | All | Unity, Social Proof | Understand shared identities (charity, health club, business council) |
| 5-6 | PERSONAL PROFILE | 5 directors | Liking | Intelligence on key decision-makers |
| 7-8 | PERSONAL PROFILE | 5 potential champions | Liking | Intelligence on emerging advocates |
| 9-10 | SEEK ADVICE | Ann Finkelbaum | Reciprocity, Liking | Build relationship with CEO; flattery through deference |
| 11-12 | SEEK ADVICE | Hillary Ross (Dir. Finance) | Reciprocity, Liking | Financial perspective; budget-oriented like Ann |
| 13-14 | SEEK ADVICE | George Glenn (Dir. HR) | Reciprocity, Liking | Organizational change expertise |
| 15 | EMAIL | All 24 managers | Awareness | Soft introduction; establish presence |
| 16-20 | FACE-TO-FACE | 5 potential champions | Reciprocity, Liking | Personal recruitment conversations |
| 21-25 | MANAGEMENT TRAINING | 5 champion candidates | Authority, Commitment | External credibility + commitment through investment |

### Champion Selection Criteria
Look for managers who demonstrate:
- Natural influence within their network clusters
- Openness to innovation (gathered from profiles)
- Connections to Ann's inner circle (leverage Unity)
- Cross-departmental relationships (maximize spread)

## Phase 2: Champion Activation & Social Proof Building (Days 26-60)

### Objectives
- Activate champions as workshop leaders
- Create visible social proof through early adopter success stories
- Begin commitment escalation across broader organization

### Initiative Sequence

| Day | Initiative | Target | Cialdini Principle | Purpose |
|-----|------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 26-30 | WORKSHOP | Led by Champion #1 | Social Proof, Commitment | Champion publicly advocates; attendees see peer endorsement |
| 28-30 | INTERNAL MAGAZINE | All | Social Proof, Authority | Article authored BY a champion (not you) |
| 31-32 | QUESTIONNAIRE | All managers | Commitment | Written commitment creates consistency pressure |
| 33-37 | WORKSHOP | Led by Champion #2 | Social Proof, Commitment | Different department, different network |
| 38-39 | MEMORANDUM | 5 interested managers | Reciprocity | Personalized value; move them toward Trial |
| 40-43 | PILOT TEST | Champion #1's department | Commitment | Escalate commitment from workshop to trial |
| 44-48 | EXTERNAL SPEAKER | All (optional attendance) | Authority | Prof. Tom Petersen validates what champions are saying |

| 52-56 | WORKSHOP | Led by Champion #3 | Social Proof, Commitment | Momentum building |
| 57-60 | PILOT TEST | Champion #2's department | Commitment | Second trial creates comparison data |

### Champion Workshop Model
Champions don't just attend workshops - they **lead** them. This creates:
1. **Deep Commitment**: Public advocacy locks in their position
2. **Peer Credibility**: "One of us" is more persuasive than outsiders
3. **Ownership**: They feel invested in EIS success
4. **Multiplication**: Each champion influences their network cluster

## Phase 3: Viral Adoption & Consolidation (Days 61-100)

### Objectives
- Achieve critical mass through network effects
- Convert remaining skeptics through overwhelming social proof
- Solidify Ann's support through success evidence

### Initiative Sequence

| 84-88 | COVERT LOBBYING | Select managers to Ann | Unity | Champions advocate directly to CEO |

## Phase 4: Final Push (Days 101-120)

### Objectives
- Convert remaining holdouts
- Institutionalize EIS as organizational norm
- Reserve authority tactics for true resistors only

### Initiative Sequence

| Day | Initiative | Target | Cialdini Principle | Purpose |
|-----|------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 101-103 | DIRECTORS MEETING | Directors + CEO | Unity | Collective decision-making moment |
| 104-105 | FACE-TO-FACE | Remaining holdouts | Liking, Reciprocity | Personal appeal; understand their concerns |
| 106-109 | PILOT TEST | Holdout departments | Commitment | Low-risk trial offer |
| 110-114 | WORKSHOP | Final session | Social Proof | "Join the majority" messaging |
| 115-120 | DIRECTIVE (if needed) | Non-adopters only | Authority, Scarcity | Last resort for true resistors |

## Key Success Metrics
- Number of active champions: Target 5-7
- Workshop attendance rate
- Pilot test conversion to adoption rate
- Network cluster penetration

# PLAN B: "The Concentric Circles Strategy"

## Core Philosophy
This strategy works from **Ann's inner circle outward**, recognizing that her loyal team structure means converting her trusted lieutenants first creates the social proof she values. Rather than going around Ann, you work through the people she trusts most. This leverages **Reciprocity** (building relationships with her team builds relationship with her), **Social Proof** (when her trusted people adopt, she follows), and **Liking** (working collaboratively rather than confrontationally).

## Theoretical Foundation

### The Social Proximity Principle
Cialdini's research demonstrates that we are most influenced by those closest to us - not geographically, but relationally. Ann's decision will be shaped primarily by what her trusted directors think and do. By starting with her inner circle and expanding outward in concentric waves, each ring of adoption adds social proof for the next.

### Reciprocity Through Genuine Partnership
Rather than positioning yourself as someone implementing change TO Teleswitches, this strategy frames you as someone working WITH them. Every interaction becomes an opportunity to provide value (expertise, connections, resources) that creates reciprocal obligation.

## Phase 1: Inner Circle Engagement (Days 1-30)

### Objectives
- Build relationships with the five directors reporting to Ann
- Understand their specific concerns and needs
- Create reciprocity through value delivery

### Initiative Sequence

| Day | Initiative | Target | Cialdini Principle | Purpose |
|-----|------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 1-3 | TASK FORCES | All | Unity | Understand organizational structure |
| 1-3 | COFFEE GROUPS | All | Social Proof | Map informal relationships |
| 4-5 | PERSONAL PROFILE | 5 directors | Liking | Deep understanding of each director |
| 6-7 | SEEK ADVICE | Ernest Stone (Customer Relations) | Reciprocity, Liking | How would EIS help customer service? |
| 8-9 | SEEK ADVICE | Hillary Ross (Finance) | Reciprocity, Liking | Budget/ROI focused conversation |
| 10-11 | SEEK ADVICE | Frank Scotti (Design) | Reciprocity, Liking | Innovation angle |
| 12-13 | SEEK ADVICE | Donald Pierce (Manufacturing) | Reciprocity, Liking | Operational efficiency angle |
| 14-15 | SEEK ADVICE | George Glenn (HR) | Reciprocity, Liking | Change management perspective |
| 16-17 | MEMORANDUM | 5 directors | Reciprocity | Personalized value based on their advice |
| 18-22 | FACE-TO-FACE | 5 directors | Liking, Commitment | Deepen relationship; gain verbal commitments |
| 23-24 | SEEK ADVICE | Ann Finkelbaum | Reciprocity, Liking | Show respect; incorporate directors' input |
| 25 | EMAIL | All managers | Awareness | Soft launch announcement |
| 26-30 | MANAGEMENT TRAINING | 5 directors | Commitment, Authority | External validation; significant commitment |

### The Advice Loop
A key tactic: After seeking advice from each director, incorporate their input visibly and report back. This creates:
1. Reciprocity (you valued their input)
2. Commitment (their ideas are now part of the plan)
3. Co-creation Unity (they're partners, not targets)

## Phase 2: First Ring Expansion (Days 31-60)

### Objectives
- Directors become advocates to their direct reports
- Begin pilot tests in willing departments
- Create documented success stories

### Initiative Sequence

- Ernest Stone: "EIS for Customer Insights"
- Hillary Ross: "EIS for Financial Transparency"
- Frank Scotti: "EIS for Design Innovation"
- Donald Pierce: "EIS for Manufacturing Efficiency"
- George Glenn: "EIS for People Analytics"

|-----|------------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| 101-103 | DIRECTORS MEETING | Final review | Unity | Collective commitment ceremony |
| 104-105 | MEMORANDUM | Holdouts | Reciprocity, Scarcity | "Here's what you're missing" |
| 106-108 | FACE-TO-FACE | Ann + Directors | All | Celebrate success; plan institutionalization |
| 109-113 | WORKSHOP | Final sessions | Social Proof | Bring stragglers into the fold |
| 114-117 | PILOT TEST | Final departments | Commitment | Complete coverage |
| 118-120 | DIRECTIVE (if needed) | True resistors only | Authority | Last resort |

# Comparison: Plan A vs. Plan B

| Dimension | Plan A: Champion Network | Plan B: Concentric Circles |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Primary Focus** | Emerging advocates from any level | Directors as primary champions |
| **Speed** | Potentially faster viral spread | More controlled, predictable |
| **Risk** | Champions may lack formal authority | Heavy reliance on director buy-in |
| **Ann Engagement** | Indirect through champions | Indirect through her trusted team |
| **Flexibility** | Adapts to who emerges as champions | Structured around org hierarchy |
| **Key Principle** | Unity + Commitment | Reciprocity + Social Proof |
| **Best If...** | Organic influencers exist | Directors are receptive |

---

## Your Choice

**Plan A** is ideal if you believe influence at Teleswitches flows through informal networks more than formal hierarchy, and if you want maximum flexibility to identify and develop whoever emerges as natural advocates.

**Plan B** is ideal if you want a more structured approach that respects organizational hierarchy and leverages Ann's trust in her directors to create cascading influence.

Both plans:
- Use a parallel top-down/bottom-up approach
- Rely primarily on soft influence (reciprocity, liking, commitment, social proof, unity)
- Reserve authority tactics (Directive) as a last resort
- Incorporate the champion development concept
- Use a balanced theory + practical approach
