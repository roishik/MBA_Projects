## Cialdini's 7 Principles of Persuasion

### 1. RECIPROCITY
People feel obligated to return favors and kindnesses.

### 2. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY
People want to be consistent with their past statements and actions. Small commitments lead to larger ones.

### 3. SOCIAL PROOF
People follow the actions of others, especially in uncertain situations.

### 4. AUTHORITY
People defer to credible, knowledgeable experts.

### 5. LIKING
People say yes to those they like - similarity, compliments, and cooperation build liking.

### 6. SCARCITY
People value what is limited or rare; fear of missing out drives action.

### 7. UNITY
People are influenced by those they perceive as part of "us" - shared identity and belonging.

## Strategic Insights from Research

### Why Traditional Authority Often Fails
Ann Finkelbaum values autonomy highly. A directive-based approach risks:
- Reactance (psychological resistance to perceived control)
- Surface compliance without genuine adoption
- Undermining long-term relationship with CEO

### The Power of "Asking for Advice"
Research shows asking for advice:
- Creates reciprocity obligation
- Flatters the advisor (liking)
- Creates commitment through verbalized opinions
- Positions you as humble and collaborative

### Coalition Building Through Unity
The Unity principle suggests targeting:
- Managers who share identities with Ann (charity involvement, business council)
- Natural social clusters for viral adoption
- Creating "co-creation" opportunities where managers feel ownership

### The Commitment Escalation Ladder
1. **Small Public Commitment**: Questionnaire, Email response
2. **Moderate Commitment**: Workshop attendance, Meeting participation
3. **Trial Commitment**: Pilot Test in their department
4. **Full Adoption**: Active EIS usage

## Key Questions for Strategy Design

1. **Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up**: Should we focus on converting Ann first, or build grassroots support that influences her?

2. **Speed vs. Depth**: Fast broadcast (Email, Magazine) vs. deep relationship building (Face-to-face, Seek Advice)?

3. **Authority Sources**: External expert vs. peer influence vs. HQ mandate?

4. **Risk Tolerance**: Use Directive (high-risk, high-reward) or softer influence tactics?

5. **Network Leverage**: Which social clusters to target first?
