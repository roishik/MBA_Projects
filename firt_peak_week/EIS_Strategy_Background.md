# The Champion Network Strategy - Background & Theory
## A Cialdini-Based Approach to EIS Implementation at Teleswitches

---

## Executive Summary

This strategy paper presents a systematic approach to implementing the Executive Information System (EIS) at Teleswitches, grounded in Robert Cialdini's principles of influence. Rather than relying on top-down authority or external pressure, the strategy cultivates **internal champions**—managers who become passionate advocates for EIS and lead the change effort from within.

The approach works on a parallel track: building grassroots momentum through champion-led initiatives while simultaneously engaging CEO Ann Finkelbaum through relationship-building and demonstrated results. Authority-based tactics are reserved as a last resort, respecting Teleswitches' culture of autonomy while maximizing adoption through social influence.

**Target**: 22 managers adopting EIS within 120 days

## Theoretical Foundation

### Cialdini's Principles of Influence

Robert Cialdini's research, spanning decades and culminating in his works *Influence* (1984) and *Pre-Suasion* (2016), identifies seven universal principles that drive human decision-making. This strategy leverages five of these principles as primary mechanisms, with two held in reserve.

#### Primary Principles Applied

**Commitment & Consistency**
Cialdini's research demonstrates that individuals who take public positions become psychologically invested in maintaining consistency with those positions. When a manager leads a workshop advocating for EIS, they create internal pressure to remain consistent with their public stance. Small commitments (attending a workshop) escalate naturally to larger ones (adopting EIS in their department).

**Unity**
The seventh principle, introduced in *Pre-Suasion*, reveals that influence is most powerful when it comes from those perceived as part of "us." Cialdini distinguishes this from mere liking: "It's not just being like you but being one of you." Champions who emerge from within Teleswitches carry inherent credibility that no external consultant or HQ representative can match.

**Social Proof**
In conditions of uncertainty, people look to the actions of others to determine correct behavior. As champions emerge and early adopters succeed, their visible commitment reduces uncertainty for others. The strategy deliberately creates observable adoption to trigger this cascade effect.

**Reciprocity**
The principle of reciprocity establishes that people feel obligated to return favors and kindnesses. By approaching managers with humility (seeking their advice) and providing genuine value (personalized memoranda, training opportunities), the strategy creates goodwill that managers feel compelled to reciprocate.

**Liking**
People prefer to say yes to those they like. Liking is built through similarity, compliments, and cooperation toward shared goals. The strategy emphasizes personal relationship-building and positions EIS implementation as a collaborative partnership rather than an imposed mandate.

#### Reserve Principles

**Authority** and **Scarcity** are held as last-resort mechanisms. While the External Speaker initiative leverages expert authority in a soft manner, formal authority (CEO Directive) is reserved only for true resistors in the final phase. This respects Ann Finkelbaum's well-documented preference for autonomy.

### Why Champions Transform Organizations

The champion model succeeds where traditional change management fails because it addresses the fundamental psychology of resistance:

1. **Ownership Transfer**: Champions feel the change is *theirs*, not something done *to* them
2. **Credibility**: Peer advocacy bypasses the skepticism directed at outsiders
3. **Commitment Lock-In**: Public advocacy makes reversal psychologically costly
4. **Network Penetration**: Champions influence their natural social clusters
5. **Sustainability**: Internal advocates remain after external consultants leave

## Situational Analysis

### The Challenge

Teleswitches, acquired by EuroComm two years ago, has systematically delayed EIS adoption despite repeated HQ requests. CEO Ann Finkelbaum has cited time constraints and competing priorities, but the underlying dynamic is one of autonomy preservation. As the "cash cow" of EuroComm, Teleswitches enjoys significant independence, and Ann has cultivated a loyal management team that mirrors her results-oriented, budget-conscious approach.

### Key Stakeholder: Ann Finkelbaum

- **Background**: Prestigious university education; values intelligence and competence
- **Tenure**: Achieved CEO position 4 years ago after long aspiration
- **Management Style**: High autonomy, loyal team development, results and budget orientation
- **External Engagement**: Active in local charities and business council
- **Implication**: Direct authority pressure will trigger reactance; she must feel ownership, not compliance

## Resource Allocation Summary

### Initiative Usage by Principle

| Cialdini Principle | Initiatives | Total Days |
|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| Commitment & Consistency | WORKSHOP (x5), PILOT TEST (x4), QUESTIONNAIRE, MANAGEMENT TRAINING (x2) | 53 |
| Unity | TASK FORCES, COFFEE GROUPS, NETWORKS, DIRECTORS MEETING (x3), COVERT LOBBYING | 25 |
| Reciprocity | SEEK ADVICE (x3), MEMORANDUM (x4), FACE-TO-FACE (x8) | 18 |
| Liking | PERSONAL PROFILE (x3), FACE-TO-FACE (x8) | 14 |
| Social Proof | INTERNAL MAGAZINE, STAFF MEETING DISCUSSION, EXTERNAL SPEAKER | 13 |
| Authority (Reserve) | DIRECTIVE (if needed) | 0-7 |

### Time Budget

| Phase | Days | Percentage |
|-------|------|------------|
| Phase 1: Intelligence & Relationship Building | 25 | 21% |
| Phase 2: Champion Activation | 35 | 29% |
| Phase 3: Viral Adoption | 40 | 33% |
| Phase 4: Consolidation | 20 | 17% |

## Success Metrics & Monitoring

### Leading Indicators
- Number of managers attending workshops voluntarily
- Quality of SEEK ADVICE conversations (openness, engagement)
- Champion enthusiasm and advocacy frequency
- QUESTIONNAIRE response rate and sentiment

### Lagging Indicators
- Managers at each stage (Awareness → Interest → Trial → Adoption)
- Pilot test success metrics
- Ann Finkelbaum's public statements about EIS
- Final adoption count (target: 22)

### Risk Indicators
- Champions losing enthusiasm → re-engage with FACE-TO-FACE
- Ann expressing resistance → increase COVERT LOBBYING from her trusted people
- Adoption plateau → identify blocking network cluster; target with WORKSHOP

## Conclusion

The Champion Network Strategy transforms the EIS implementation challenge from an external imposition into an internal movement. By identifying and cultivating managers who become genuine advocates, the strategy leverages Cialdini's most powerful principles—Commitment, Unity, and Social Proof—while respecting Teleswitches' culture of autonomy.

The approach recognizes that Ann Finkelbaum will not be persuaded by authority; she will be persuaded by her own people succeeding. Every initiative is designed to either build relationships, create champions, or demonstrate results that make EIS adoption the obvious choice.

When the strategy succeeds, it won't feel like EuroComm imposed a system on Teleswitches. It will feel like Teleswitches chose to adopt a system that their best people championed.
